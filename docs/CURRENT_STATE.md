# NEBULA — Current State

## Last Updated

2026-10-14.

This document describes only what is currently implemented and working.

Do not place future plans or speculative features here.

---

## Project Status

Current phase:

FIRST PLAYABLE IMPLEMENTATION / GAME-005 COMPLETE

The project has a working browser application, development toolchain and placeholder gameplay scene.

The player ship supports responsive desktop keyboard movement.

---

## Working Toolchain

Installed and verified:

- Node.js 24
- npm
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Phaser 4.2.1
- Vitest
- Git

Repository:

- Git repository initialized
- main branch
- GitHub remote configured
- project pushed successfully

---

## Quality Commands

Available commands:

### Development

npm run dev

Starts the Vite development server on IPv4 localhost (127.0.0.1).

### Type Check

npm run typecheck

Runs TypeScript without emitting files.

### Tests

npm test

Runs Vitest.

There are currently no test files. Desktop movement is implemented locally in GameplayScene.

### Production Build

npm run build

Runs TypeScript compilation and creates the Vite production build.

### Full Check

npm run check

Runs:

1. typecheck
2. tests
3. production build

Current status:

PASS

---

## Current Runtime

The project boots Phaser in the browser and transitions from BootScene into GameplayScene.

Current screen:

- 4800x2700 dark-space placeholder arena with deterministic static stars and an outer boundary
- cyan player ship placeholder starting at the arena center, drawn with Phaser geometry
- one stationary red diamond enemy placeholder in world space at (2800, 1350)
- desktop movement using WASD or arrow keys
- "NEBULA — GAMEPLAY SCENE" label
- "Placeholder space arena" text

Rendering:

- Phaser 4.2.1
- WebGL
- 1920x1080 internal viewport (separate from the larger arena)
- landscape
- FIT scaling
- centered canvas

## Implemented Gameplay

A player ship placeholder is rendered in GameplayScene and controlled with WASD or arrow keys.
Movement is immediate at 300 pixels per second, uses frame delta, and normalizes diagonal direction.
Releasing movement keys stops the ship without inertia.
The ship starts at world position (2400, 1350).
Movement is clamped inside the 4800x2700 arena using half the ship dimensions plus its outline.
The main camera follows the ship immediately and is bounded to the arena.
Browser resizing preserves the internal viewport and responsive 16:9 FIT presentation.
Exactly one stationary enemy placeholder is visible near the player starting area.
Enemy chase, dynamic spawning and combat are not implemented.

There is currently no:

- enemy chase
- enemy spawning
- weapons
- targeting
- damage
- health
- death
- XP
- progression
- upgrades
- boss
- save system
- advertisements
- Yandex Games integration

This is intentional.

---

## Assets

No production game assets are currently integrated.

The Vite demonstration assets have been removed.

Gameplay prototypes will initially use placeholders and simple geometry.

---

## Tests

No gameplay unit tests exist yet.

Vitest is installed and configured.

Tests should be introduced when meaningful game logic appears.

Do not create meaningless placeholder tests only to increase test count.

---

## Known Non-Blocking Warnings

### AudioContext

Browser may warn that Web Audio cannot start before user interaction.

This is expected browser behavior.

Audio is not implemented yet.

### Bundle Size

The production bundle currently produces a Vite warning because Phaser makes the JavaScript chunk larger than 500 kB.

This is not currently considered a problem.

Do not optimize bundle splitting before there is a demonstrated need.

---

## Current Architectural Complexity

Intentionally minimal.

Not implemented:

- ECS
- global event bus
- dependency injection
- platform abstraction
- save abstraction
- content pipeline
- asset manifest
- DevTools framework
- code graph integration

These should only be introduced when real project requirements justify them.

---

## Next Step

The placeholder arena, bounded desktop movement, camera follow and stationary enemy are implemented and browser-verified.

The next implementation task is:

GAME-006 — Enemy Chase Movement

---

## Current Playable State

The application boots successfully.

The player can move the ship with desktop keyboard controls around one stationary enemy placeholder. Combat is not implemented.

The next major goal is the First Playable milestone defined in GAME_DESIGN.md.
